<h4>Final assigment - be creative.</h4>

<p>
    Thank you for reaching the end of the Tutorial. Hope you learned something useful and had fun on the way.
</p>

<p>
    <b>As a final task</b>, we would like to ask you to come up with an interesting example of a simple application and <b>try to implement it in Endev</b>. Think of something that could help you track information from some (or several) APIs. Or if you always wanted to store some data in a digital format (e.g. your personal movie or trips database), but never got around to it because you thought setting up everything would be too much work.
</p>
<p>
    Send us anything that you come up with (doesn't have to be right away). If you start implementing and get stuck, send us the unfinshed code. If you just come up with examples and don't have time to try making it, send us the description (maybe we build it for you :P).
</p>
<p>
    Anything will be good. Please email the solutions to <a href="mailto:fkis@kth.se">fkis@kth.se</a>.
</p>
<p>
    And of course, any feedback is always welcome.
