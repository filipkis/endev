<h1 id="start">Endev Tutorial</h1>
<div class="well">
    <p>The goal of the tutorial is to get familiar with Endev and how to use it for rapid prototyping. To achieve this you will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Learn about Endev on-the-fly creation of own data</li>
        <li>Learn about the real-time&nbsp;nature of Endev&rsquo;s own data and storing it in the cloud</li>
        <li>Learn about accessing API data (through YQL or REST)</li>
        <li>Combine data from different data sources using Endev</li>
        <li>Provide feedback on Endev&rsquo;s design</li>
        <!--<li><span class="c20">(Advanced) Find out behind the scenes explanation of Endev&rsquo;s core (Angular, Firebase, YQL)</span></li>-->
    </ul>
</div>
<h2 ><a></a>0. Rapid prototyping, no JavaScript, declarative annotations and data</h2>
<p>The purpose of Endev is to empower non-programmers and programmers alike to build interactive interfaces that allow you to display and edit data. And to <b>do it fast</b>. That way you can quickly build a demo of your idea to test with the potential users or clients, or build&nbsp;an interface for your personal birthday wish list so that even your grandmother can use it :)</p>
<p>There are certain challenges we are faced with when working with data. From where you store it, how you read the data that&rsquo;s all around (more than 14k APIs out there) to the the technical challenges (spaghetti-code, endless callbacks, etc.). </p>
<p>Endev address these through two core principles: </p>
<p>First, <b>declarative annotations</b>&nbsp;hide the nitty-gritty aspects of writing code (that&rsquo;s often the same and repetitive) to access the data and instead lets you just say <b>what</b>&nbsp;data you want and <b>where</b>&nbsp;do you want it. </p>
<p>Second, by utilizing <b>cloud services </b>Endev removes certain configuration requirements (like installing a database to store your data) and overhead (programming a web server just so you can read APIs that don&rsquo;t support cross-origin resource sharing). </p>
<p>So how does that look like? Let&rsquo;s find out&hellip;</p>
<h3><a></a>About the tutorial setup</h3>
<p>Throughout the tutorial you will be shown examples of code and will be encouraged to play with it as well. The code will be presented in CodePen, an interactive tool for working with snippets of HTML. You can choose to stay inside CodePen and play there. You can freely modify the examples (by selecting Edit on Codepen in upper left corner of every example) and click Run to see the modifications. If you want to save your modifications you need to click Fork. You don&rsquo;t need to even have an account to do that, but if you want to be able to later find your code easily it&rsquo;s suggested that you do create an account. </p>
<p>If instead you want to work outside CodePen that&rsquo;s easy as well. Endev does not require any special installations. The only thing you need is a text editor (not Word, but Notepad or TextEdit or similar, I would recommend <span><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime</a></span>) and a browser. You can then create a text file and save it with html extension (e.g. &ldquo;example01.html&rdquo;). Finally, add the following code to your file:</p>
<div class="code">
    <p class="c1"><span class="c7">&lt;!DOCTYPE</span> <span class="c15 c11">html</span><span class="c7">&gt;</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c7">&lt;/head&gt;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c7">&lt;body&gt;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c14"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c7">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c5">&lt;!-- CODE FROM THE EXAMPLES COMES HERE --&gt;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c14"><span class="c17"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c7">&lt;/body&gt;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c7">&lt;/html&gt;</span></p>
</div>
<p>And then you just copy the code from the examples to the dedicated location. To test the code just open your file in the browser.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2><a></a>1. On-the-fly creation of own data</h2>
<h4>1.1 The static WishList example</h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine we want to create a small app to manage our birthday (or Christmas, wedding, etc.) wish list and to be able to share it with others. To start with we want to have a very simple interface, just to enter content into the list. Below you can see the interface and HTML code needed to create it.</p>
<p data-height="340" data-theme-id="21624" data-slug-hash="LGyJzm" data-default-tab="html" data-user="filipkis" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis/pen/LGyJzm/'>Endev Tutorial: 1.1</a> by Filip Kis (<a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis'>@filipkis</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<h4>1.2 Insert and list the data</h4>
<p>So far, so good. However, the interface at the moment does not do anything. Entering a new value and clicking on the button will not change anything. So how do we achieve that? Before we start adding functionality we need to think about what data we need to store. For this first version we only need a collection of all the wishes (let&rsquo;s call it <b>WishList</b>) where each item in the collection will have a <b>name</b>. Now let&rsquo;s add the first 4 annotations that will make the list dynamic and allow us to add new data to it. </p>
<p data-height="340" data-theme-id="21624" data-slug-hash="KVmGaX" data-default-tab="html" data-user="filipkis" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis/pen/KVmGaX/'>Endev Tutorial: 1.2</a> by Filip Kis (<a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis'>@filipkis</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<p><span class="
glyphicon glyphicon-hand-up text-primary" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Test the example"></span> Go ahead, play with it a bit and add some items.</p>
<p>
    <a href="#e12" data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-info btn-xs" ng-click="explain('e12')">Explain the example</a>
    <div class="collapse" id="e12">
        <div class="well">
<p>Let&rsquo;s understand better what the new annotations represent: </p>
<ul>
    <li>with <span class="attribute">data-value</span>&nbsp;annotation we have declared a reference label <span class="statement">itemName</span>&nbsp;for the value entered into the input box. This allows us to reference that value in other places (as we will see soon).</li>
    <li>with <span class="attribute">data-click</span>&nbsp;annotation we declare what should happen when the button is clicked. In this case <span class="statement">insert({name:itemName})</span>&nbsp;specifies that a new object should be inserted into a collection and that its name should be the value from the input box (referenced by itemName). But what collection does it get inserted in?</li>
    <li>well that&rsquo;s what <span class="attribute">insert-into=</span><span class="statement">&quot;WishList&quot;</span>&nbsp;is for. This annotations specifies the collection where the data from the <span class="statement">&quot;insert(...)&quot;</span> operation is supposed to go. And this is our desired WishList collection.</li>
    <li>finally, we replaced the two static list items (&lt;li&gt;..&lt;/li&gt;) we had before with one annotated with a <span class="attribute">from</span>&nbsp;annotation where we define the query to get the data. This way we have defined a template that will be duplicated for each element in the retrieved data. In our case we said <span class="statement">WishList item</span>&nbsp;meaning we want to get the data from <span class="statement">WishList</span>&nbsp;and <span class="statement">item</span><b>&nbsp;</b>label to reference the individual item (similar to how we used itemName earlier). We can see how the item is used inside the {{item.name}} where we just want to display the item&rsquo;s name. Double curly brackets are used whenever we want to just display data we have somehow retrieved or created through annotations.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>Now if you have any experience with web you may think: &ldquo;This is a nice trick, but if I close my browser the data will be lost&rdquo;. Well, go ahead and try <span class="
glyphicon glyphicon-hand-up text-primary" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Test the example"></span>. Still there? If you opened the same browser&nbsp;your data should still be there. The catch is in &ldquo;the same browser&rdquo;. Endev use browser storage to dynamically create your data structure and store your data. It is similar to how cookies work and that is why the data is only local and in another browser or another computer you would not see it. But we will solve this issue soon. </p>
<h4>1.3 Edit the existing items</h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s add a bit more functionality to our interface. For instance, how about if we want to edit the items on the list (in case we made a typo). To do this we simply need to change the list template in a way that we: put the name in the input box (instead of just displaying it as we did so far) and add a button to save the changes. Here&nbsp;is the updated code:</p>
<p data-height="340" data-theme-id="21624" data-slug-hash="vLZYae" data-default-tab="html" data-user="filipkis" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis/pen/vLZYae/'>Endev Tutorial: 1.3</a> by Filip Kis (<a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis'>@filipkis</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<p>
    <a href="#e13" data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-info btn-xs"  ng-click="explain('e13')">Explain the example</a>
    <div class="collapse" id="e13">
        <div class="well">
<p>The new <span class="statement">update(item)</span>&nbsp;statement associated with <span class="attribute">data-click</span> annotation works in a similar way to previously seen <span class="statement">insert</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<h4>1.4 Update as you type</h4>
<p>Having an update button is a bit old-fashioned interaction method. Modern web applications today, instead, save your changes as soon as you make them. And as you might have guessed it, all it takes is one more annotation :) In fact, as we are going to remove the button it will actually be less code than previous example. Here it is:</p>
<p data-height="340" data-theme-id="21624" data-slug-hash="xZrxmE" data-default-tab="html" data-user="filipkis" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis/pen/xZrxmE/'>Endev Tutorial: 1.4</a> by Filip Kis (<a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis'>@filipkis</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<p>
    <a href="#e14" data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-info btn-xs"  ng-click="explain('e14')">Explain the example</a>
    <div class="collapse" id="e14">
        <div class="well">
<p>We have removed the button added in previous step, and instead added the annotation <span class="attribute">auto-update</span>&nbsp;on the same element where we have <span class="attribute">from</span>. This way we are declaring that any changes that happen in the interface to the items retrieved by the query should automatically be saved (i.e. the WishList should be updated).</p>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<h4>1.5 Remove items from the list</h4>
<p>As a final step in this part of the tutorial let&rsquo;s add a feature to remove the items from the list. Let&rsquo;s use the link (with text &ldquo;X&rdquo;) instead of using those big buttons:</p>

<h4>Let&rsquo;s recap what we have learned in this part of the tutorial:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Endev supports interactivity with data through HTML annotations</li>
    <li><span class="attribute">from</span>&nbsp;annotation can be used to retrieve data from arbitrary collections (if one does not exist it will be created for you on-the-fly) and combined with <span class="attribute">auto-update</span>&nbsp;also saves any changes that the user does to the data through the interface</li>
    <li><span class="attribute">data-click</span>annotations in combination with insert(...), update(...) or delete(...) statements can be used to do exactly that, insert, update or delete the data</li>
    <li><span class="attribute">data-value</span>&nbsp;annotation is used to give as a reference to values in input elements</li>
    <li>The data has, for now, been only stored in the browser</li>
</ul>
<h2><a></a>2. Real-time applications and data in the cloud</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we have seen how to create a simple interactive application with real data that gets created on-the-fly. All of this was achieved using the Endev JavaScript library, but without writing a single line of JavaScript code. Instead of writing the code to tell our application <b>how </b>to get the data, we used annotations to declare <b>what</b>&nbsp;data we want and <b>where</b>&nbsp;we want it. Endev took care of the rest.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s see what else can Endev do for us. In fact, in all of our examples from the previous chapter there was an important feature that we didn&rsquo;t discuss. We already know that the data is stored in the browser and if we restart it, our data should not be lost. But what happens if you open this tutorial in two tabs of your browser and edit the data in one of them? Well, in fact, the data will be instantly synced to the other tab as well. <span class="
glyphicon glyphicon-hand-up text-primary" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Test the example"></span> Go ahead and try this on the last example from previous chapter:</p>
<p data-height="340" data-theme-id="21624" data-slug-hash="KVqKYj" data-default-tab="html" data-user="filipkis" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis/pen/KVqKYj/'>Endev Tutorial: 1.5</a> by Filip Kis (<a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis'>@filipkis</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<p>This is a so called real-time synchronization technique and apps that support it are called <b>real-time apps</b>&nbsp;with most famous example being Google Docs.</p>
<h4>2.1 Putting the data into the cloud</h4>
<p>To put this into the context of our WishList application, creating a list just for ourselves is not so much fun (who will then get us all those nice things). Our goal from the start was to be able to share the list with others. And real-time support ensures that as soon as somebody makes a change to the list, others can see it right away. However, we have a big limitation in our current app - the data is stored only in the browser. So to share it, somebody would actually need to use our computer and that&rsquo;s, of course, not what we had in mind. </p>
<p>Here is where Endev&rsquo;s second core principle comes to play. Remember what was the second principle? Cloud services. By using a cloud service called Firebase, Endev taps into the power of real data storage that can be accessed from anywhere. And since it is a cloud service, it doesn&rsquo;t require complex setup and maintenance. In fact, for this tutorial you will need no setup at all. </p>
<p><b>Note:</b>&nbsp;Since now the data is stored in the cloud, the data is shared with&nbsp;anybody taking this tutorial at the same time. Just so&nbsp;that&nbsp;you are not surprised if new things start appearing and disappearing from the list :)</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how we can &ldquo;turn on&rdquo; this feature in Endev. Here is our example from before, but now running with Firebase:</p>
<p data-height="340" data-theme-id="21624" data-slug-hash="BjZyoM" data-default-tab="html" data-user="filipkis" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis/pen/BjZyoM/'>Endev Tutorial: 2.1</a> by Filip Kis (<a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis'>@filipkis</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<p>
    <a href="#e21" data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-info btn-xs"  ng-click="explain('e21')">Explain the example</a>
    <div class="collapse" id="e21">
        <div class="well">
<p>It looks almost the same. The only difference is that where we used <span class="statement">WishList</span>&nbsp;before now we have <span class="statement">firebase:WishList</span>. With this change we have told Endev that we do not want to anymore take the information from local browser storage, but instead from Firebase. In fact, the previous annotation we used for local storage was just a shortcut version, the full version would be <span class="statement">local:WishList</span>. We can already start to see a pattern here of how we define different services (providers). In the next chapter we will see two more services that we can use to access the data.</p>
<p>As with local storage, Endev will create the WishList (or any other name you put there) collection in Firebase if one didn&rsquo;t exist before. </p>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<h4>2.2 Allowing the others to register for lists</h4>
<p>Time to make our WishList app shareable. The interface we have built so far is for managing the wish list, however we do not want our friends or family to start adding or removing the items on the list. So let&rsquo;s create a new interface where they will only be able to see the list and choose what they want to get (before you do that, make sure you have some items in the list if you deleted them in previous step):</p>
<p data-height="340" data-theme-id="21624" data-slug-hash="EPXazQ" data-default-tab="html" data-user="filipkis" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis/pen/EPXazQ/'>Endev Tutorial: 2.2</a> by Filip Kis (<a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis'>@filipkis</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<p>
    <a href="#e22" data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-info btn-xs"  ng-click="explain('e22')">Explain the example</a>
    <div class="collapse" id="e22">
        <div class="well">
<p>This example shows already familiar <span class="attribute">from</span> and <span class="attribute">data-click</span>&nbsp;with <span class="statement">update(..)</span> annotations. However, there are two new things to notice here. </p>
<p>First, a new annotation <span class="attribute">data-if</span>&nbsp;is used to make an element appear only when&nbsp;a specific condition&nbsp;is fulfilled. We wanted &ldquo;[reserved]&rdquo; to appear next to the items&nbsp;that somebody has already registered for. </p>
<p>Second, we are using the <span class="statement">update</span> statement in a new way. The first argument (<span class="statement">item</span>), as before, tells us which object will be updated, but the second argument specifies what information to update. This is useful when we do not have input boxes or other similar controls but we still want to change some values. We could, for instance, say <span class="statement">update(item, { registered:true, when: $now() })</span>&nbsp;where we would also set item&rsquo;s <span class="statement">when</span>&nbsp;property to know when somebody registered. <span class="statement">$now()</span> is a special function in Endev that gives you the current date and time.</p>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<h4>2.3 Showing the list of items user registerd for</h4>
<p>Now that the users can register for an item, it would be nice that they also know what they registred for. Remember, now that we use Firebase service, everybody will see the same list. So it might happen that somebody forgets what they decided to get. One way we could do this is having people sign up with their name (and maybe other information), but let&rsquo;s look at different way so we can explore another feature of Endev - possibility to combine data from different services. </p>
<p>To achieve our goal, we can store the items that a user has registered for in the local browser storage. That way each user will see only their own list (of course, only if looking with the same browser, but for prototyping purpose we can be satisfied with that).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look how that can be achieved:</p>
<p data-height="340" data-theme-id="21624" data-slug-hash="MKoweO" data-default-tab="html" data-user="filipkis" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis/pen/MKoweO/'>Endev Tutorial: 2.3</a> by Filip Kis (<a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis'>@filipkis</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<p>
    <a href="#e23" data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-info btn-xs" ng-click="explain('e23')">Explain the example</a>
    <div class="collapse" id="e23">
        <div class="well">
<p>First, we decided to store the list of items the user is getting in the local <span class="statement">ToGetList</span> (note: we used <span class="statement">local:ToGetList</span> to make it more obvious when reading the code that it&rsquo;s the local storage, but <span class="statement">local:</span> prefix could have been omitted as it is the default). To do this we added extra statement to our <span class="attribute">data-click</span> annotation: <span class="statement">insert(item)</span>. However, insert statement requires insert-into annotation as well which specifies where the data is supposed to be inserted - in our case that is the <span class="statement">ToGetList</span>. Finally, we are displaying content of that list below the wish list.</p>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<h4>2.4 Hiding taken items from the main list</h4>
<p>Now, instead of showing &ldquo;reserved&rdquo; next to the item that&rsquo;s been taken in the wish list, we could consider only showing the items that are not yet taken. In other words, we want to filter out the wish list:</p>
<p data-height="340" data-theme-id="21624" data-slug-hash="JGJYjP" data-default-tab="html" data-user="filipkis" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis/pen/JGJYjP/'>Endev Tutorial: 2.4</a> by Filip Kis (<a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis'>@filipkis</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<p>
    <a href="#e24" data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-info btn-xs"  ng-click="explain('e24')">Explain the example</a>
    <div class="collapse" id="e24">
        <div class="well">
<p>To filter any data, we use <span class="attribute">where</span> annotation in combination with <span class="attribute">from</span>. The statement of the where annotation specifies the condition. In our case the condition is <span class="statement">item.registered !=&nbsp;true</span>. If we want to specify several conditions we can separate them with <span class="statement">AND</span>. For instance, if we would have a price property of the item on the list and wanted to add also a condition that the price must be less than 100 the statement would look like <span class="statement">item.registered != true AND item.price &lt; 100</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<h4>2.5 Allowing users to remove themselves from an item</h4>
<p>As a final task, let&rsquo;s add the remove button so the users can change their mind. Naturally, the item should then appear back in the list as not registered:</p>
<p data-height="340" data-theme-id="21624" data-slug-hash="pgwjOm" data-default-tab="html" data-user="filipkis" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis/pen/pgwjOm/'>Endev Tutorial: 2.5</a> by Filip Kis (<a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis'>@filipkis</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<p>
    <a href="#e25" data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-info btn-xs"  ng-click="explain('e25')">Explain the example</a>
    <div class="collapse" id="e25">
        <div class="well">
<p>The button needs to do two things: it needs to update the item in the <span class="statement">WishList</span>&nbsp;to make it not registered anymore and delete the item from the <span class="statement">ToGetList</span>. Both of these actions are described with the, by now, familiar <span class="attribute">data-click</span>&nbsp;annotation. However we needed extra <span class="attribute">from</span>&nbsp;and <span class="attribute">where</span>&nbsp;annotations on the button. The reason is that the update statement needed a reference to which item in the <span class="statement">WishList</span>&nbsp;to update. If we just wrote <span class="statement">update(getItem, ...)</span> the item in the <span class="statement">ToGetList</span>&nbsp;would be updated. If, on the other hand, we wrote <span class="statement">update(item, &hellip;)</span>, &nbsp;where item refers to &nbsp;the one from the list we used at the beginning of the code, that wouldn&rsquo;t do anything. Endev references that are defined by&nbsp;<span class="attribute">from</span>&nbsp;annotation are only available inside the element where they are defined. Therefore, we needed to use a new <span class="attribute">from</span>&nbsp;annotation and limit it, with the <span class="attribute">where</span>&nbsp;annotation, to those items that are the same as the item in our <span class="statement">ToGetList</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>This is what we call <b>nested queries</b>. In other words, queries where results from one query is used to effect the other query. The <span class="attribute">insert-into</span>&nbsp;part in this example is another such query, albeit a more simpler one.</p>
<h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star text-primary" aria-hidden="true"></span> Do it yourself</h4>
<ol>
    <li><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil text-primary" aria-hidden="true" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Do it yourself"></span> Add posibility to specify price in the list menagement interface (same as task 1.1 from the previous chapter) and then in the interface for sharing with the user allow them to filter by price (e.g. entering certain value and getting items in the list that are cheaper then specified)<div from="firebase:Answers an" where="an.id = '2.1'" default="{'id':'2.1'}" auto-insert="true" auto-update>
        <textarea data-value="an.answer" placeholder="Add a link to your solution OR copy/paste the code here OR write comments in case you have issues/questions" cols="50" class="form-control"></textarea>
    </div><button class="btn btn-xs btn-primary" data-click="insert({'id':'2.1'})" insert-into="firebase:Answers">Add another</button></li>
</ol>
<h4>Summary of what we have learned in this chapter</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Endev supports <b>real-time applications</b>, in other words, data in your interface is kept in sync between different users/instances of your application</li>
    <li>You can use <b>Firebase</b>&nbsp;service to have the data stored in the cloud and accessible from anywhere</li>
    <li><span class="attribute">where</span>&nbsp;annotation in combination with <span class="attribute">from</span>&nbsp;allows us to filter the results of the query</li>
    <li>You can combine data coming from different data sources. For instance, adding data from one source to another or using the data from one source to filter the data in the other one. When doing so you will get the so-called <b>nested queries</b></li>
    <li>The <span class="attribute">data-if</span> annotation can be used to show and hide elements depending on the value assigned to it</li>
</ul>
<h2><a></a>3. Accessing API data</h2>
<p>In the previous chapters we have worked with data we created ourselves. We either created and stored it locally, in the browser, or using a service to store data in the cloud so it can be accessed from anywhere. Normally applications that we design will have some own data, as in our examples, but there is also plenty of data already out there that can be used and combined to build useful, creative and fun applications. </p>
<!--<p>The data that is prepared to be accessed by our applications is made available through APIs (Application Programing Interfaces). According to a ProgrammableWeb, a website for tracking APIs and applications that use them, there is more than 14 500 APIs currently out there. They range from APIs for accessing social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, etc.), through various online databases (IMDb, AllRecepies, etc.) to more and more open-governance trends where cities, municipalities and even countries create and expose APIs to relevant data (public transport information, weather, traffic, events, etc.). And with more and more devices getting connected (the Internet-of-Things buzzword) that number of APIs will grow quickly.</p>-->
<p>There is a variety of issues concerned when working with API data. From finding the right data for your needs, understanding it, getting access to it (not all data is open or easily accessible), using the right technology to read it; all the way to increasingly popular field for data science that aims at developing complex algorithm combined with scientific analysis to gain new knowledge from it. It is for sure an interesting domain and even though you can probably find &ldquo;an app&rdquo; for anything these days, there are still plenty of possibilities for creating new or improving existing applications.</p>
<h4>3.1 Accessing the data from REST API</h4>
<p>In this chapter we will work with APIs and touch upon some of the mentioned issues and see how Endev combines various methods to resolve them. To start with let&rsquo;s look at a simple example of two APIs&nbsp;that are accessed through Endev annotations:</p>
<p data-height="340" data-theme-id="21624" data-slug-hash="MKobwv" data-default-tab="html" data-user="filipkis" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis/pen/MKobwv/'>Endev Tutorial: 3.1</a> by Filip Kis (<a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis'>@filipkis</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<p><span class="
glyphicon glyphicon-pencil text-primary" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Do it yourself"></span> Try and see what happens when you add <span class="attribute">explain=</span><span class="statement">&quot;lottery&quot;</span> to the element that uses <span class="attribute">from</span> to query the lottery results.</p>
<p>
    <a href="#e31" data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-info btn-xs"  ng-click="explain('e31')">Explain the example</a>
    <div class="collapse" id="e31">
        <div class="well">
<p>Both examples use REST APIs which are basically web links but instead of going to a nice webpage they display raw data. The raw data can come in different formats, but in recent years JSON format (what you see for example if you look at <span><a href="http://apis.is/lottery">http://apis.is/lottery</a></span>) became most dominant. </p>
<p>If you click on the titles of the two APIs, they will lead you to the documentation where you can see what are all the API endpoints (other name for the API web addresses) and parameters (the values you see at the end web address, typically after &ldquo;?&rdquo; mark). On the Open Movie Database page we can see that there is only one endpoint (http://www.omdbapi.com/?) and there are several parameters that we can send. You can also test your inputs on their website, but the results are not very readable. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get back to our example. In the first case we are using the <span class="attribute">from</span>&nbsp;annotation to access the movie API. As we before specified firebase:WishList and local:ToGetLis, now we use the web address to specify that we want to access the API. The address must include the &ldquo;http:&rdquo; or &ldquo;https:&rdquo; as that&rsquo;s how Endev knows it is a REST API. We can already see some parameters (i.e. ?<span class="statement">plot=short&amp;r=json</span>) defined in the web address. When accessing REST APIs you can choose whether&nbsp;to keep the parameters in the <span class="attribute">from</span>&nbsp;annotation or define them in the <span class="attribute">where</span> statement. Apart from <span class="attribute">where</span>&nbsp;statement being more readable, more importantly, it gives us a familiar way of defining conditions that link to other parts of the interface. In this example, we compare the <span class="statement">t</span>&nbsp;property to the value in the input field represented by <span class="statement">title</span> reference. As soon as we type something in the input box, the new API data will be retrieved that satisfies the given conditions.</p>
<p>In the second example we have a much simpler API that displays the results of Icelanding Lotto draws. The lottery API gives us data where the actual data of interest nested under the <span class="statement">results</span>&nbsp;property. Therefore, we need to use nested queries to access it. Luckily the documentation website contains the nice example where we see how the data looks like. However, as we saw with the previous example, that is not always the case. In such situations there is an <span class="attribute">explain</span>&nbsp;annotation that can be placed next to the <span class="attribute">from</span>&nbsp;annotation such as <span class="attribute">explain=</span><span class="statement">&quot;lottery&quot;</span>. <span class="
glyphicon glyphicon-pencil text-primary" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Do it yourself"></span> Go and try it out and see what happens? The annotation temporary replaces anything that&rsquo;s inside the element annotated with <span class="attribute">from</span>&nbsp;and instead just displays the full data retrieved from the API. You can use it for testing and exploring the data.</p>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<h4>3.2 Using YQL service for uniformed access to supported APIs</h4>
<p>Working with API endpoint addresses tedious: finding the right address, knowing what parameters to use, different syntaxes and results formats, etc. &nbsp;It is time to bring out the fourth and final service provider (remember we had local storage, Firebase and REST so far) - Yahoo Query Language (YQL). YQL is an online service that can be seen as a proxy to many other data sources.</p>
<p>YQL uses what they call &ldquo;data tables&rdquo; to define different data sources. The tables have certain parameters (some optional, other mandatory) that can be set through <span class="attribute">where</span>&nbsp;conditions. Based on the table you specify and the conditions you set in your request, YQL knows how to transform that information into a call to the actual web service and then it reads and returns the results. </p>
<p>To explore what data sources YQL supports we can use&nbsp;<span><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/?q=select%20*%20from%20json%20where%20url%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fapi.open-notify.org%2Fiss-now.json%22%20">YQL Console</a></span>. There you can see the list of supported tables on the left side by clicking on them an example of how to use them. The initial list contains only the tables that relate to Yahoo service (flicker, Yahoo Weather, etc.), but if you select &ldquo;Show Community Tables&rdquo; you can get more than 1000 tables that allow you to access many other services including popular ones like Twitter, Google, etc. And all of those table and their data can be accessed through Endev. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example that uses YQL to access the public photos on from Flickr API. Furthermore, the example lets you save the photos to your private collection (using local store). The example contains minimal styling (the class attributes) to make it better fit on the page:</p>
<p data-height="340" data-theme-id="21624" data-slug-hash="ZQJGPo" data-default-tab="html" data-user="filipkis" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis/pen/ZQJGPo/'>Endev Tutorial: 3.2</a> by Filip Kis (<a href='http://codepen.io/filipkis'>@filipkis</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<p><span class="
glyphicon glyphicon-pencil text-primary" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Do it yourself"></span> Try adding <span class="attribute">describe=</span><span class="statement">&quot;flickr.photos.search&quot;</span> to the element with similar <span class="attribute">from</span> and see what happens.</p>
<p>
    <a href="#e32" data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-info btn-xs"  ng-click="explain('e32')">Explain the example</a>
    <div class="collapse" id="e32">
        <div class="well">
<p>By now you probably know to first look for <span class="attribute">from</span> annotation as that is where we always start from. It looks similar to how we used it with local storage and Firebase, i.e. we start with stating the service and the data table we want to use <span class="statement">yql:flickr.photos.search</span> followed by <span class="statement">result</span>&nbsp;- the future reference label of our choosing that will hold the results. In the <span class="attribute">where</span> statement we specify the attributes that the API needs. If we are not sure what parameters can be used, we can use <span class="attribute">describe=</span><span class="statement">&quot;flickr.photos.search&quot;</span>&nbsp;annotation. <span class="
glyphicon glyphicon-pencil text-primary" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Do it yourself"></span> Go ahead, try it out. It works similar to how we used <span class="attribute">explain</span>&nbsp;earlier to see all the raw data, just instead it show the possible parameters. This annotation works only with YQL service. It will not give us the meaning of the parameters, but it will link to API&rsquo;s documentation (when known to YQL) where more information on the parameters can be found. </p>
<p>The second <span class="attribute">from</span>&nbsp;annotation is an interesting new case. Flickr API returns a result that is not directly a collection of images. Instead it returns an object that has property called <span class="statement">photo</span> where the collection of photos matching our search will be present. Therefore, we need a second <span class="attribute">from</span>&nbsp;annotation that access that collection. This time we don&rsquo;t specify any service because Endev already knows where <span class="statement">result</span> comes from. Often data we work such nested collections and we will need to use nested queries to access them. </p>
<p>Another interesting case with Flick API is that it does not give us exact address of the image, but instead gives use pieces of information (server, server farm, id, etc.) that we then combine into a full address in the <span class="attribute">src</span> attribute of image element to show the photo. </p>
<p>The image tag also contains already familiar annotations for inserting the image into PhotoCollection local storage. We have, however, decided not to store the only the parts, but the full address in our private collection, therefore we combine it again when passing it into the <span class="statement">insert</span>&nbsp;statement.</p>
<p>Finally, we list the photos from our PhotoCollection.</p>

<h4>3.3 Accessing any API with YQL (and avoiding CORS problems)</h4>
<p>When working on the client side code, as we&rsquo;ve been working so far, there is a limitation to accessing certain APIs in the form of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). CORS poses certain security risk and for those reasons it&rsquo;s normally not enabled, which in turn prevents us from accessing the data from the browser code. What we would need in such case is a server to read the needed data and send it back to us. However, because it&rsquo;s turned off by default, there are many open APIs that have no security concerns (they share the open data) but still are not accessible in this way. A small example is this API that gives the <span><a href="http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/">location of the International Space Station</a></span>. Try reading it with Endev <span class="
glyphicon glyphicon-pencil text-primary" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Do it yourself"></span>.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t get anything, that&rsquo;s OK. It is not supposed to work. Luckily, YQL can help with that as well. Let&rsquo;s finding out where the International Space Station is:</p>

    <div class="collapse" id="e33">
        <div class="well">
<p>In this example we use a special YQL data table called <span class="statement">json</span>&nbsp;that allows us to get the data from any REST API that returns JSON format. To specify the address of the API we use the <span class="attribute">url</span> parameter in the <span class="attribute">where</span> statement. There are other generic tables that can read CSV, HTML, XML, etc. And why does it solve the problem of CORS? Well, the actual data access and processing happens on the Yahoo servers and then CORS is not an issue.</p>

<h2>5. Final assigment - be creative.</h2>

<p>
    Thank you for reaching the end of the Tutorial. Hope you learned something useful and had fun on the way.
</p>

<p>
    <b>As a final task</b>, we would like to ask you to come up with an interesting example of a simple application and <b>try to implement it in Endev</b>. Think of something that could help you track information from some (or several) APIs. Or if you always wanted to store some data in a digital format (e.g. your personal movie or trips database), but never got around to it because you thought setting up everything would be too much work.
</p>
<p>
    Send us anything that you come up with (doesn't have to be right away). If you start implementing and get stuck, send us the unfinshed code. If you just come up with examples and don't have time to try making it, send us the description (maybe we build it for you :P).
</p>
<p>
    Anything will be good. Please email the solutions to <a href="mailto:fkis@kth.se">fkis@kth.se</a>.
</p>
<p>
    And of course, any feedback is always welcome.
